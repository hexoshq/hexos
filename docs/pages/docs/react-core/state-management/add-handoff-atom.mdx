Write atom that records a handoff event with auto-generated ID and timestamp.

Called by [useAgent](/docs/react-core/hooks/use-agent#useagent) when an `agent-handoff` event arrives. Updates both
[handoffHistoryAtom](/docs/react-core/state-management/handoff-history-atom#handoffhistoryatom) and [lastHandoffAtom](/docs/react-core/state-management/last-handoff-atom#lasthandoffatom).
