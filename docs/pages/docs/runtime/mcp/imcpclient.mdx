<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/runtime/src/mcp/IMCPClient.ts" sourceLine="20" packageName="@hexos/runtime" />

Common interface for Model Context Protocol (MCP) client implementations.

Defines the contract that all MCP clients must fulfill, regardless of the underlying
transport mechanism (STDIO or SSE). Clients must handle connection lifecycle, tool
discovery, and tool execution according to the MCP protocol specification.

Extends EventEmitter to support event-driven communication patterns such as error
handling and connection state changes.

Implemented by [MCPClient](/docs/runtime/mcp/mcpclient#mcpclient) (STDIO transport) and [MCPSSEClient](/docs/runtime/mcp/mcpsseclient#mcpsseclient) (SSE transport).
Managed by [MCPManager](/docs/runtime/mcp/mcpmanager#mcpmanager) for multi-server orchestration.

```ts
interface IMCPClient extends EventEmitter {
    connect(): Promise<void>;
    listTools(): Promise<MCPToolInfo[]>;
    callTool(name: string, args: unknown): Promise<unknown>;
    disconnect(): void;
    isConnected(): boolean;
}
```
* Extends: EventEmitter

### connect

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`() => Promise<void>`} />

Establish connection to the MCP server.

For STDIO clients, this spawns the child process and performs the MCP handshake
(initialize + initialized notification). For SSE clients, this establishes the
SSE connection and initializes the MCP client instance.

Must be idempotent - calling multiple times should not create duplicate connections.
### listTools

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`() => Promise<<a href='/docs/common/mcp/mcptool-info#mcptoolinfo'>MCPToolInfo</a>[]>`} />

Retrieve all tools available from the connected MCP server.

Sends a tools/list request via the MCP protocol and returns tool metadata
including names, descriptions, and JSON schemas for input validation.
### callTool

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`(name: string, args: unknown) => Promise<unknown>`} />

Execute a tool on the MCP server with the provided arguments.

Sends a tools/call request and returns the result. The MCP protocol returns
content arrays (text/image/resource items), which implementations typically
extract and parse into usable formats.
### disconnect

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`() => void`} />

Terminate the connection to the MCP server and clean up resources.

For STDIO clients, this kills the child process. For SSE clients, this closes
the transport and MCP client instances. Should clear all pending requests and
reset connection state.
### isConnected

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`() => boolean`} />

Check whether the client is currently connected to the MCP server.
