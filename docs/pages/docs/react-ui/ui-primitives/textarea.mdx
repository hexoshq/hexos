<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/react-ui/src/primitives/Textarea.tsx" sourceLine="47" packageName="@hexos/react-ui" />

Auto-resizing textarea component.

Provides a textarea that automatically adjusts its height based on content when `autoResize` is enabled.
Height is constrained between `minHeight` and `maxHeight` props.

The component recalculates height on every onChange event, expanding or contracting to fit content
while respecting the maximum height constraint with scrolling.

Uses imperative handle to expose the internal ref while supporting forwarded refs from parent components.

*Example*

```tsx
<Textarea
  autoResize
  minHeight={80}
  maxHeight={200}
  placeholder="Type a message..."
/>
```
